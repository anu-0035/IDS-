## IDS-
Intrusion Detection System using  Open-CV



An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using OpenCV in Python leverages a webcam or camera to monitor a scene in real-time. 
This system detects motion or unusual activities, such as a person entering a restricted area.
By using computer vision techniques, the system can identify changes in the environment and trigger alerts if an intrusion is detected.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the system works:

#Project Description:
The goal is to create a system that can:

Monitor live camera feed: Continuously stream video from a camera or webcam.
Detect movement: Identify significant changes between consecutive frames to detect motion.
Mark intrusions: Highlight the detected object (intruder) on the video feed and track movement.
Trigger alerts: When motion is detected, the system can log the event or trigger alarms (such as sending notifications or sounding an alarm).

##Key Components:
  #Video Capture:
  
    Capturing real-time video from a camera using OpenCV's VideoCapture function.
  
  #Motion Detection:
  
    Detecting motion through frame differencing or using background subtraction techniques.
    A background subtraction algorithm like MOG2 or KNN will subtract the background from the current frame to highlight moving objects (the potential intruder).
  
  #Marking Intrusions:
  
    Once motion is detected, bounding boxes can be drawn around the detected intruder.
  
  #Logging and Alerts:
  
    The system can be extended to log events in a file or trigger an alert when motion is detected, such as sending an email or text notification.
